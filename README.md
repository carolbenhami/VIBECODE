# VIBECODE
##What did you build?<br/>
I built a simple slot machine program where players start with $100 and depending on how many symbols match for every spin, they get a different prize.<br/><br/>

##What language(s) or tools did you use?<br/>
I utilized Python and the TKInter module to be able to integrate GUI features to my code.<br/><br/>

##Which AI tools did you use, and how?<br/>
##What did you do versus what AI helped with?<br/>
I used Claude and ChatGPT to help me with my code. I created all the logic behind the slot machine, and I had already used TKInter before, but I did not get to a good result. So this time, I fed the Claude with the structure and logic and asked it to complete the GUI part for me.<br/><br/>

##What’s one thing you’re proud of?<br/>
I am proud of actually being able to build the logic for the slot machine in a considerably short amount of tome. Also, after I got the code from the AI, I made sure to go over every step and make sure I understood it, and this time I understood better how to use TKInter to integrate python with a nice GUI.<br/><br/>

##What’s one thing you’d improve with more time?<br/>
If I had more time, I would have made the movements and appearance look better. Also, I was trying to build a mainpage for the casino so the slot machine was just one of the minigames on it, but I did not have enough time to finish accomplishing it.
