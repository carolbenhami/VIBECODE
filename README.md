# VIBECODE
What did you build?\n
I built a simple slot machine program where players start with $100 and depending on how many symbols match for every spin, they get a different prize.\n

What language(s) or tools did you use?\n
I utilized Python and the TKInter module to be able to integrate GUI features to my code.\n

Which AI tools did you use, and how?\n
What did you do versus what AI helped with?\n
I used Claude and ChatGPT to help me with my code. I created all the logic behind the slot machine, and I had already used TKInter before, but I did not get to a good result. So this time, I fed the Claude with the structure and logic and asked it to complete the GUI part for me.\n

What’s one thing you’re proud of?\n
I am proud of actually being able to build the logic for the slot machine in a considerably short amount of tome. Also, after I got the code from the AI, I made sure to go over every step and make sure I understood it, and this time I understood better how to use TKInter to integrate python with a nice GUI.\n

What’s one thing you’d improve with more time?\n
If I had more time, I would have made the movements and appearance look better. Also, I was trying to build a mainpage for the casino so the slot machine was just one of the minigames on it, but I did not have enough time to finish accomplishing it.
